# ICPHackathon - TEAM ELEPHANTS

Project Visual

## We are
Ali Gökalp Karakuş, Zeynep Selin Özkal, and Deniz Ceylan, junior Computer Science students from Ege University. With a shared passion for gaming, we’ve honed our skills in cutting-edge technologies, including Web3, game development, mobile applications, and AI/ML. Our diverse expertise allows us to approach challenges creatively and build impactful solutions. As developers who enjoy blending innovation with purpose, we are committed to leveraging technology to make a difference—whether in gaming or projects like EleChain, aimed at protecting endangered species. Together, we’re driven by curiosity, collaboration, and a vision for a better, tech-driven future.

## Description
EleChain is a full-stack blockchain application designed to protect and monitor endangered Asian elephants. Built on ICP Motoko, EleChain leverages decentralized technology to track the real-time location, health status, and movement patterns of these majestic animals. By ensuring transparency and data security, the platform enables wildlife conservationists, organizations, and governments to collaborate effectively in safeguarding elephant populations.

## Vision
EleChain envisions a world where Asian elephants thrive, free from the threats of poaching, habitat loss, and neglect. By harnessing the power of blockchain technology, our goal is to provide accurate, real-time data to conservationists, enabling quicker responses to risks and ensuring better health monitoring.

## Project Ideas
- ICP and .dfx

## Programming Language
- Motoko & Web3

## Software Development Plan for EleChain

1- Smart Contract Development
Design and implement smart contracts on the Internet Computer using Motoko to handle:
Elephant Registration: Variables for storing ID, name, GPS location, health data, and guardian organization details.
Health Updates: Functions for updating and validating health metrics (e.g., weight, vitals, and overall health score).
Location Tracking: Real-time storage and verification of GPS coordinates.
Donations & Sponsorships: Functions for accepting funds, assigning them to specific elephants or projects, and providing detailed transparency for sponsors and donors.
Access Control: Roles and permissions for different user types such as organizations, conservationists, and sponsors.

2- Database Integration
Set up Canisters for storing large and frequently updated data, such as detailed health records and movement history.
Use hashes or summaries stored in the blockchain layer to ensure data integrity while maintaining scalability.

3- Frontend Development
Create a user-friendly interface that interacts with the Internet Computer:

Dashboard for Conservationists: Real-time maps showing elephant locations, health alerts, and tools for generating reports.
Donor Portal: A platform for viewing elephant profiles, sponsoring elephants, and tracking contributions.
Public Awareness Section: Showcase highlights of rescued elephants, success stories, and conservation progress to engage the public.
Integrate the front-end with Motoko-based smart contracts using the ICP Agent library or other compatible tools for seamless interactions.

4- Data Visualization and Alerts
Develop visual elements such as interactive maps, health status graphs, and risk alerts to make data intuitive and actionable.
Implement notification systems to alert users about emergencies, like health risks or unusual location activity, via email or in-app messages.

5- Testing and Security
Conduct rigorous testing of smart contracts written in Motoko to ensure they are secure, optimized, and bug-free.
Perform front-end usability testing to guarantee smooth and intuitive user navigation.
Implement penetration testing to secure the entire application against external threats.

6- Deployment and Launch
Deploy canisters and smart contracts on the Internet Computer mainnet.
Host the front-end application on the ICP ecosystem or a compatible platform.
Launch with a pilot program to gather user feedback and iterate for improvements.
