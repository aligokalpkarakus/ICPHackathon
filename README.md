## We are
Ali Gökalp Karakuş, Zeynep Selin Özkal, and Deniz Ceylan, junior Computer Science students from Ege University. With a shared passion for gaming, we’ve honed our skills in cutting-edge technologies, including Web3, game development, mobile applications, and AI/ML. Our diverse expertise allows us to approach challenges creatively and build impactful solutions. As developers who enjoy blending innovation with purpose, we are committed to leveraging technology to make a difference—whether in gaming or projects like EleChain, aimed at protecting endangered species. Together, we’re driven by curiosity, collaboration, and a vision for a better, tech-driven future.

## Description
EleChain is a full-stack blockchain application designed to protect and monitor endangered Asian elephants. Built on ICP Motoko, EleChain leverages decentralized technology to track the real-time location, health status, and movement patterns of these majestic animals. By ensuring transparency and data security, the platform enables wildlife conservationists, organizations, and governments to collaborate effectively in safeguarding elephant populations.

## Vision
EleChain envisions a world where Asian elephants thrive, free from the threats of poaching, habitat loss, and neglect. By harnessing the power of blockchain technology, our goal is to provide accurate, real-time data to conservationists, enabling quicker responses to risks and ensuring better health monitoring.
